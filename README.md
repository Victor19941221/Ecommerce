## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (local or cloud)
- [Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) with API keys

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ecommerce.git
cd ecommerce
```

2. **Configure `appsettings.json`**

Update the file with your MongoDB and Stripe settings:

```json
"MongoSettings": {
  "ConnectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
  "DatabaseName": "EcommerceDB"
},
"Stripe": {
  "PublishableKey": "your-publishable-key",
  "SecretKey": "your-secret-key"
},
"Admin": {
  "Email": "vlarsson347@gmail.com"
}
```

> The `Admin:Email` is used to seed an admin role to this user if the email matches an existing user.

3. **Restore Dependencies and Run the App**

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

The app will be available at `https://localhost:5001`
